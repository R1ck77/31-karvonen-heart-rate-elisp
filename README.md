## Exercise 31: Karvonen heart rate

Elisp solution of exercise 31 from "Exercises for Programmers" by Brian P. Hogan.

All challenges that could be reasonably solved have been completed (the one requiring a slider being a notable exception).

### Usage

Eval ``karvonen.el`` and then then execute the command ``M-x karvonen``.

Enter your base heart rate, your age and watch the magic unfold.

Then sigh, murmur "meh" and go doing something better.
